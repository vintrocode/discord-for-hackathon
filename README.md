# Discord for Hackathons
Collection of resources outlining why and how you should use Discord for a virtual hackathon. Based off the [MLH guide](https://guide.mlh.io/).


## Why Discord?

Discord has historically had the stereotype of being a chat app targeted towards gamers, so its professional use cases are quickly dismissed. However, I've personally seen the power of Discord when used effectively and it has significantly changed my view towards it. The goal of this document is to walk through the logistics of a hackathon and outline how to use Discord as the one-stop-shop for the entire event.

##### Why not slack, teams, or anything else?

The functionality of Discord is greater than most other apps. Not only does it have channels like slack, it also has free voice and video rooms like Zoom. You have more control over the server with _roles_, where you can control who sees what channels, who can add/delete/modify things, etc.

And according to this viral tweet, "slack is a boomer discord"

## Main components of a Hackathon

I'd like to break down each of those components...

#### Check-in
We want to know who attended and how to reach them. [This blog post](https://medium.com/techtogether/part-2-how-to-automate-the-check-in-process-for-hackathon-attendees-with-the-zira-bot-b79553ba484d) outlines a great way to use a bot to automate check-in. **Bots are a heavily leveraged in Discord for some very cool features.** 

#### Opening ceremony
Could edit together a nice video welcoming everybody to the hackathon. Possibly string together multiple clips of people saying things? Live stream on YouTube, Twitch? Possibilities are endless here, but you can announce when the event is happening in the `#announcements` channel, which _only the event organizers_ have access to post in.

#### Workshops
These can be live streamed or pre-recorded and "premiered". The events can be announced in the `#announcements` channel, and they can link to the appropriate platform. Depending on the streaming platform, there can be a chat for real-time interaction with the presenter. I attended a virtual conference (Adobe MAX) that I thought was run very well -- instead of live-streaming, they had their presenters pre-record their videos and "premiere" them at a certain time. They added that time to their schedule along with a link to the video itself, and the experts who made the presentation were available in the chat to help and answer questions. This model allowed for very efficient time management since they could impose a time cap on the pre-recorded workshops submitted. As far as format goes, these were often just screen recordings with talking head bits. I personally found this method to be extremely effective for 1. respecting everyone's time, 2. helping people asynchronously, and 3. making the recording more concise and useful. I found myself spending an extra 30 mins to an hour replaying certain parts of the workshop to really hammer home the skills demonstrated. With more concise, pre-recorded videos, it was easier for me to "put in work after class" so-to-speak. This is all just personal opinion, however. Take it with a grain of salt.
