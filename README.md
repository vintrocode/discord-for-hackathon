# Discord for Hackathons
Collection of resources outlining why and how you should use Discord for a virtual hackathon. Based off the [MLH guide](https://guide.mlh.io/).


## Why Discord?

Discord has historically had the stereotype of being a chat app targeted towards gamers, so its professional use cases are quickly dismissed. However, I've personally seen the power of Discord when used effectively and it has significantly changed my view towards it. The goal of this document is to walk through the logistics of a hackathon and outline how to use Discord as the one-stop-shop for the entire event.

##### Why not slack, teams, or anything else?

The functionality of Discord is greater than most other apps. Not only does it have channels like slack, it also has free voice and video rooms like Zoom. You have more control over the server with _roles_, where you can control who sees what channels, who can add/delete/modify things, etc.

I'd like to break down each of those components...

#### Check-in
[This blog post](https://medium.com/techtogether/part-2-how-to-automate-the-check-in-process-for-hackathon-attendees-with-the-zira-bot-b79553ba484d) outlines a great way to use a bot to automate check-in. *Bots are a big thing in Discord* We want to know who attended and how to reach them.

#### Opening ceremony
Could edit together a nice video welcoming everybody to the hackathon. Possibly string together multiple clips of people saying things? Regardless,
